# sleipnirJS 0.5.*

## current version
*Sleipnir comes in three versions. The first and main version is heavily based on meta-programming enabled by ES5 (IE9+), but we do also provide an ES3 (IE8-) version. An ES6 version is also presented as an experiment and exploration (only working on Firefox as for now).*
- ES6: 0.5.alpha
- ES5: 0.5.1
- ES3: 0.5.4

## what is sleipnir?

Imagine Backbone or any like-minded MVC framework as that nice knitted pullover your grandmother made for you last year: a nice looking green pullover with a cute deer on the front-side. Sleipnir is actually the same stuff, turned inside out â€” you can see the raw fabric and sewing work.
Sleipnir is a toolbox library to help you build your own MVC framework, and provides core concepts and mechanisms on which you can build upon: we're not forcing you to adapt to one paradigm, we're enabling you to build your own.

## key points
- simple and efficient way to manage classes and OOP in JavaScript
- event-driven development made easy
- MVC base mechanisms ( Model, and Collection )
- an abstract Router class, that can do a lot, lot more than just routing urls
- adaptation of some ES6 sweetness
- no DOM purposes (*do it your own way*)

## call for arms
There's a lot of work to be done. And things to be changed. *you. can. help.*
