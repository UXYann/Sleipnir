- ES5: 0.5.1
- ES3: 0.5.3

## What is sleipnir?

Imagine Backbone or any like-minded MVC framework as that nice knitted pull your grand-mother offered you last christmas: a nice looking green pull with a cool deer drawing on the front side. Sleipnir is actually the same pull, turned inside out â€” you can see the raw fabric and sewing work.
Sleipnir is a toolbox library to help you build your own MVC framework, and provides core concepts and mechanisms on which you can build upon: we're not forcing you to adapt to one paradigm, we're enabling you to build your own.

## key points
- simple and efficient way to manage classes and OOP in JavaScript
- event-driven development made easy
- MVC base mechanisms ( Model, and Collection )
- an abstract Router class, that can do a lot, lot more than just routing url
- no DOM purposes ("do it your own way")
