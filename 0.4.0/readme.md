## version 0.4.0a01
### support : firefox 4+, ie9+, safari 6+ (5?), chrome 7+, opera 12+

Sleipnir is a Javascript framework that aims to make easier for developers to organize their front-end website architecture.
While still in its early youth and under heavy development, the milestone 0.4.0 should be ready enough to power a website.

## key concepts
- 100% OOP
- 100% event based
- MVC ready
- provides core classes you can and are encouraged to build upon, and it's freaking easy!
- manages resources loading and dependencies with ease
- looks and feel like real JavaScript
- no UI-binding, obeys to the more-and-more-forgotten rule of separating HTML, CSS and JS

## quick start

Version 0.4.0 is a complete overhaul of sleipnir, which now makes an heavy use of ES5 features.
